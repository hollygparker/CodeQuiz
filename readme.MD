# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

# Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to utilize the Document Object Model to navigate through the quiz by hiding and showing elements along the way. It uses Javascript logic to render elements hidden or otherwise.

# My Experience
I had a good time troubleshooting small errors along the way. At one point some strange styling was appearing with nothing inside it, and I had to discover how to hide that one unexpected element.
